This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

Note: Sometimes the API doesn't work well it returns `This site can't be reached`. This is why I'm attaching a video link for the preview if it does not work.

## Covered Topic
1. Create custom UI components for the app, using React,
2. Display a list of movies sorted in descending order of popularity.
3. Show the movie title, image, genre, cast, director, and a short description related to the movie in each Movies Details Screen.
4. Load a total of only 20 movies for each year
5. By default, when a user lands on the page, display a list of movies of the year 2012
6. Implement smooth scrolling behavior to load more movies as the user scrolls in any direction i.e load movies of previous year when user scrolls up and load movies of next year when user scrolls down until the current year.
7. As and when the user scrolls and movies are added to the list, make sure that this interaction is smooth and doesnâ€™t cause any jitters.
8. Provide a filter UI that allows users to filter movies by genre.
9. Fetch genres from this API and show genres as filters
10. When a user selects one or more genres, the list should only display movies of the selected genres. Please note that whenever a user selects a genre, a fresh list of movies should be fetched from the API for that particular genre.
11. Write well-structured and maintainable code.
12. You can use React, Vue, or any library to create your own reusable components
13. Avoid using any pre-built component libraries (e.g., Bootstrap, Tailwind, etc.) for creating UI components.
14. Implement this project in React Native instead of a web app.
15. Ensuring smooth scrolling even when more and more movies are loaded in the DOM.

## Topic not covered
1. Implement a search bar which searches for the movie based on the search string and displays an infinite loading list of movies which matches the search.
2. Use TypeScript for enhanced type safety and code quality.
   

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till the "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Clone this repo and install all necessary packages which are required

First, you will need to clone this repository

To clone this repository run the following command inside any directory.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Niranjan-Baur/MovieFix.git
```
and then to install all the necessary packages, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm i
OR
npm install
```

## Step 2: Start the Metro Server

Then, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

OR

npm run debug
```

## Step 3: Start your Application

Please wait for a few moments depending on your system configuration. Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal with the following options.

```bash
i - run on iOS
a - run on Android
d - open Dev Menu
j - open debugger (experimental, Hermes only)
r - reload app
```
Note: `j - open debugger (experimental, Hermes only)` This option will only come if you start Metro using the `npm run debug` command from above.

### For Android

Then just press `a` in the terminal to run this project in your _Android Emulator_ or _Android Device_ (if it is connected to your machine)

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _Android Device_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.
